## In search of a master portfolio piece

FIEA was the number 1 game development masters program in the world according to Princeton Review 2016. Which means, I had my work cut out and create a portfolio piece which really stands out.

The main requirements of the portfolio were:

1. **Code** should be preferrably in C++
2. Simulation / Games are given higher weightage
3. Code quality and standards will be evaluated

The golden solution, port my 2D Verlet physics simulation in Javascript to C++ using SDL and improve the framework architecture. Also while I'm at it, use C++ 11, since that was the main focus of almost all the recommended reading. The result was an interesting 2 to 3 weeks and an awesome portfolio piece.
