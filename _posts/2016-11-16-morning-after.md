## The Morning After

Video Games started in the early days with just pure gameplay experiences with little or no story about the player or the world at all. Over
the years games have evolved to a point where almost all of them have some sort of a background story about why the player doing what he/she
is doing and what the world is all about. MorningAfter was done with story telling as the focus point. The player starts at the door of an
apartment and then figures out what happened the previous night. Environmental story telling was used to help players find out what happneded
through interactions with objects in the environment. The original idea was to make the main character's gender identity neutral so that anyone
can play and relate it to themselves. Since the prototype had to be made in 2 weeks along with other regular course work we had to cut the scope
and stick to a gender. The team behind this game had 6 members with two programmers including myself. I worked primarily on creating configurable
environmental interaction components which can be reused / extended for multiple interaction types.
