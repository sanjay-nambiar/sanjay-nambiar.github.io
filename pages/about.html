My name is Sanjay Nambiar. I'm a game programmer currently working at [Iron Galaxy Studios](http://irongalaxystudios.com/).

I have 5 years of software industry experience, and have worked at some great software companies such as Amazon and IBM Software Labs. Game programming was always my passion and now my full
time focus.
