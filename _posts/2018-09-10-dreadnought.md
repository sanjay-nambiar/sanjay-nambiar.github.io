#### Introduction
Dreadnought is a spaceship combat flight simulator for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows. Players can select ships, customize loadouts and unlock better ships and upgrades as they play more and gain credits and experience. There are multiple game modes and most of them involve you playing in a team with other players. The game has a moba like element to it and requires players to choose the right ships as a team to support each other.

#### What I worked on
The game is built in Unreal Engine, using both C++ and blueprints extensively.
