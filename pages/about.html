My name is Sanjay Nambiar. I'm a programmer and game developer. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Interactive Entertainment
at <a href="http://fiea.ucf.edu/">FIEA</a>, University of Central Florida. I have 5 years of software industry experience, worked
at companies like Amazon and IBM Software Labs prior to my entry into games industry.

Game programming was always my passion and now my full time activity. You can read about all my projects and ideas here. If I am not
programming or playing games, I like to be outdoors.
